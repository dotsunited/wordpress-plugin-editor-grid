WordPress Editor Grid Plugin
===

A lightweight WordPress Plugin to create and manage grids via the WordPress Post Editor.

Installation
---

Install with

```bash
composer require dotsunited/wordpress-plugin-editor-grid
```

Note: This plugin does not automatically add the required styles to the frontend
pages (only to the Admin Editor), in order to prevent multiple css files from
multiple plugins in the site header (which would ruin the pagespeed).

The incorporation into a [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) workflow
with LESS is encouraged.

You can find an example boilerplate for possible frontend styles
[here](https://github.com/dotsunited/wordpress-boilerplate/blob/master/assets/main/editor-grid/style.less),
and for a possible WordPress-Webpack setup
[here](https://github.com/dotsunited/wordpress-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js).

The HTML generated by the plugin looks like this:

```html
<div class="editor-grid editor-grid-shadow editor-grid-background">
    <div class="editor-grid-container">
        <div class="editor-grid-unit editor-grid-unit-6 editor-grid-shadow editor-grid-background-highlight">
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
        <div class="editor-grid-unit editor-grid-unit-6 editor-grid-background">
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
